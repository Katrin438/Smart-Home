##Important! Demo and more technical version
We have two versions of the app, the one we showed in the demo is on branch "demo_version" and one which is more complete from a technical point of view but lacks a bit in design inside of branch "menu".Switch between branches to not miss something from our progress.

##Concept:

“How can Denis save up money from hidden house costs so he can afford a family trip and involve the kids in the process as well.”
Our target group is a very busy individual with a lot going on in his daily life. He tries to work as hard as possible by taking up any available shift in addition to that he has a family with four kids leaving him with almost no spare time. His top priority is his family. He wants to save up money to provide for his family and go on family trips to spend some quality time with them.
He needs to find hidden pockets of time in his day to spend with his family and eliminate hidden costs in the home so those funds can go towards a vacation or trip.
By using the “Home helper” app . He will be able to reduce his energy costs by up to 25% and involve his children in these activities. By using this app he will be able to connect and control  smart technologies around his home . This would in turn save a person both money and time. Home helper turns these activities into possible mini games to play with the kids. 
The user will be able to maintain a certain ambient temperature only in rooms that are currently used, turning off all appliances (unless specified otherwise) when leaving home, managing light sources etc. The app will gather data to show “hotspots” where the most amount of energy is used and ways to optimize it. Schedules can be configured to automatically execute certain actions.
